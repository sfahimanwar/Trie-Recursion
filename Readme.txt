This project is to better understand Trie data structures and recursion better.

All .java files are in the src directory. Compile and run files using javac and java command or run from src file in IntelliJ

The Trie data structure uses key/value pairs like a HashMap to store string keys and their associated String values. Strings can be searched in the structure using recursion.
